            <p class="paragraph">Hello my name is Darwin Grant, I am currently employed at the Blue Island Oyster Bar.
                Before the Oyster Bar I received my Bachelors Degree from the University of Colorado Denver in
                International Studies and a minor in Ethnic Studies.
                I chose this degree because I wanted to learn more about the world we live in and the cultures that make
                us all unique. I developed a passion for not recognizing the difference between people, but more so what
                people had in common besides their differences.
            </p>

            <p>I have been with the Oyster Bar for three years and its has brought great opportunity for me and my
                family. My roles at the Oyster Bar include service and management, which takes great patience and
                customer service skills. In this position I learned how to make the most out of meeting new people on a
                daily basis.
